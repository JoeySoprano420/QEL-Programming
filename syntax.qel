define Fibonacci of number â†’ wholeNumber {
    if number is 0 or number is 1, return number
    otherwise return Fibonacci of (number minus 1) plus Fibonacci of (number minus 2)
}

wrap Double of number:
    return number times 2

wrap Square of number:
    return number times number

define Process of value using method:
    return method of value

result is Process of (4 using Square)

define Compute of value:
    attempt:
        return value divided by 2
    if fails:
        retry using safeDivision of value
    if still fails:
        estimate based on closest known value

repeat until success:
    try Task of userInput
    if failed:
        fix userInput

remember userInfo as important
